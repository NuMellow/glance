## Intro
Glance is a picture frame-like e-ink tablet that is designed to display glance-able information thoughout the week. 

## Getting Started


## Contributing, adding and suggesting your own apps
I made this project primarily to explore using e-ink displays and so may/may not continue to make apps for it. That being said though if you want to make your own apps for Glance, you can either fork this repo and create to your heart's content or pull this repo and create a pull request to have it added to this project. Or if you have app requests you could create an issue with the "App request" label and who knows, I just might make it.
